Time yourself with a simple click!

If you want to measure for example the time you worked and exclude all the pauses you made, this is what you need. 
The OneClickTimer uses a single button to measure that timespan.
I recommand using a [picoclick](https://makermoekoe.com/2020/12/08/picoclick/) for this project, because it is the perfect fit and you can support a fellow maker.
First click on the button will start the time. Next click will stop it.

The backend application will keep track of what happend. 

There is also a frontend that shows you all the information you need.
