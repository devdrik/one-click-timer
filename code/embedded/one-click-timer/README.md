# OneClickTimer Embedded section

This is the code for the hardware. Use platformio in e.g. vscode to flash your device.
A description on to do that can be found here: https://devdrik.de/arduino-in-vs-code/ (use translate if you have to)

The code is coded to work with the [picoclick by maker.moekoe](https://makermoekoe.com/2020/12/08/picoclick/). So your best shot is to get a picoclick and use that!
